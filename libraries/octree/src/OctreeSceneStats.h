    //
    // 1) number of octrees sent can be calculated as _colorSent + _colorBitsWritten. This works because each internal
    //    element in a packet will have a _colorBitsWritten included for it and each "leaf" in the packet will have a
    //    _colorSent written for it. Note that these "leaf" elements in the packets may not be actual leaves in the full
    //    tree, because LOD may cause us to send an average color for an internal element instead of recursing deeper to
    //    the leaves.
    //
    // 2) the stats balance if: (working assumption)
    //     if _colorSent > 0
    //          _traversed = all skipped + _colorSent + _colorBitsWritten
