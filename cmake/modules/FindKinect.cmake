#  FindKinect.cmake
#
#  Try to find the Perception Kinect SDK
#
#  You must provide a KINECT_ROOT_DIR which contains lib and include directories
#
#  Once done this will define
#
#  KINECT_FOUND - system found Kinect SDK
#  KINECT_INCLUDE_DIRS - the Kinect SDK include directory
#  KINECT_LIBRARIES - Link this to use Kinect
