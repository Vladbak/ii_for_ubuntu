High Fidelity (hifi) is an early-stage technology lab experimenting with Virtual Worlds and VR. 

In this repository you'll find the source to many of the components in our 
alpha-stage virtual world. The project embraces distributed development 
and if you'd like to help, we'll pay you -- find out more at [Worklist.net](https://worklist.net). 
If you find a small bug and have a fix, pull requests are welcome. If you'd 
like to get paid for your work, make sure you report the bug via a job on 
[Worklist.net](https://worklist.net).

We're hiring! We're looking for skilled developers;

Documentation
=========
Documentation is available at [docs.highfidelity.com](http://docs.highfidelity.com), if something is missing, please suggest it via a new job on Worklist (add to the hifi-docs project).

Build Instructions 
=========
All information required to build is found in the [build guide](BUILD.md).

Running Interface
===
When you launch interface, you will automatically connect to our default domain: "root.highfidelity.io".

If you don't see anything, make sure your preferences are pointing to 
root.highfidelity.io (set your domain via Cmnd+D/Cntrl+D), if you still have no luck it's possible our servers are 
simply down; if you're experiencing a major bug, let us know by adding an issue to this repository. 
Make sure to include details about your computer and how to reproduce the bug. 

To move around in-world, use the arrow keys (and Shift + up/down to fly up or 
down) or W A S D, and E or C to fly up/down. All of the other possible options 
and features are available via menus in the Interface application.

Running your own servers
========
The assignment-client and domain-server are architectural components that will allow 
you to run the full stack of the virtual world.

In order to set up your own virtual world, you need to set up and run your own 
local "domain". 

The domain-server gives a number different types of assignments to the assignment-client for different features: audio, avatars, voxels, particles, meta-voxels and models.

Follow the instructions in the [build guide](BUILD.md) to build the various components.

From the domain-server build directory, launch a domain-server.

    ./domain-server

Then, run an assignment-client. The assignment-client uses localhost as its assignment-server and talks to it on port 40102 (the default domain-server port).

In a new Terminal window, run:

    ./assignment-client

Any target can be terminated with Ctrl-C (SIGINT) in the associated Terminal window.

This assignment-client will grab one assignment from the domain-server. You can tell the assignment-client what type you want it to be with the `-t` option. You can also run an assignment-client that forks off *n* assignment-clients with the `-n` option.

    ./assignment-client -n 4

To test things out you'll want to run the Interface client.

To access your local domain in Interface, open your Preferences -- on OS X this is available in the Interface menu, on Linux you'll find it in the File menu. Enter "localhost" in the "Domain server" field.

If everything worked you should see that you are connected to at least one server.
Nice work!
